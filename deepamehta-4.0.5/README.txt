DeepaMehta 4
============

DeepaMehta 4 is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management. The vision of DeepaMehta is a Post-Desktop Metaphor user interface that abolishes applications, windows, files, and folders in favor of stable personal views of contextual content. The goal of DeepaMehta is to provide knowledge workers of all kind a cognitive adequate work environment, right after booting.

Technically DeepaMehta 4 is made of  
Java, Neo4j, Apache Lucene, Apache Felix, Jetty, Jersey (server-side),  
Javascript/AJAX, jQuery, jQuery-UI, HTML5 Canvas, and TinyMCE (client-side).

DeepaMehta 4 is a rewrite of DeepaMehta 2.  
(DeepaMehta 3 was a research & development effort.)

Do not use it in any productive and/or professional environment!

Thank you for your understanding!


Requirements
------------

**Java 1.6** and a "modern" **webbrowser**.

Works fine with Firefox 3.6 (or newer) and Safari 5. Works mostly fine with Chrome 5 (or newer).  
Doesn't work with IE8. Potentially works with IE9.


Install
-------

Download the latest release and unzip it.  
<https://github.com/jri/deepamehta/downloads/>

A folder `deepamehta-4.0.5` is created.


Start
-----

Open the `deepamehta-4.0.5` folder and use the respective starter script for your platform:

    deepamehta-linux.sh         # choose "Run in terminal"
    deepamehta-macosx.command   # double-click it
    deepamehta-windows.bat      # double-click it

While DeepaMehta starts a terminal window opens and you see some information logged.  
Then a browser window opens and DeepaMehta is ready to use.

If no browser window appears open it manually:  
<http://localhost:8080/>


Stop
----

Go to the terminal window that opened while startup and press:

    Ctrl-C

This puts the database in a consistent state and shuts down the webserver.  
You can close the terminal window now.


Update
------

Updating from DeepaMehta 2 or 3 to DeepaMehta 4 is currently not supported.  
Even updating from 4.0.x to 4.0.5 is currently not supported.  
Please see the note at the top.


Reset the database
------------------

Sometimes you might required to restart DeepaMehta with a fresh database.  
To do so a) stop DeepaMehta, b) delete the `deepamehta-db` folder, and c) start again.


Uninstall
---------

Stop DeepaMehta and delete the `deepamehta-4.0.5` folder.  
This removes DeepaMehta completely from your computer, including the database.
